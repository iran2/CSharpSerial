Serial Communication with C# in Visual Studio 2013


I realized that THERE IS NO single working version of C# Serial Communication using Windows Forms Application in Visual Studio 2013! Then, I decided to create one good version that is capable of working properly.

It is 100% tested and ready to rock and roll! Howevere, there is still lots of rooms to improve it and add other features.

all you need is to run the .sln file in the zipfile and select your comport name and baudrate. Or simply use the .exe file in the Debug Folder.

You need a loopback adapter or you can make one. You will send for instance '@' and you will receive the same character!

You are very welcome to go ahead and add changes!

***Please feel free to check the SerialV.2 for fixing glitches.
